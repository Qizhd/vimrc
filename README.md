#My vim config file mainly for web developer
I use vim to write markdown, python, ruby, Erlang/Elixir, php, javascript, C, C++, bla bla bla...

## Usage
1. checkout this repo to ~/.vim
2. create directory `bundle` under ~/.vim/:

        mkdir ~/.vim/bundle
3. create a soft link under ~/ to ~/.vim/.vimrc:

        ln -sf ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/
4. run `vim`, I know there would be some errors, just press any key to ignore that this time. 
run `:PluginInstall` to install all the requirements.
5. restart your `vim` and welcome to the new world!
